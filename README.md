All you need to know to use the One-Click Miner(OCM) is your wallet address and the pool you wish to mine to.
The OCM also allows you to run your own P2Pool node if you are running a Vertcoin Wallet locally on your computer.

-P2Pool-
First if you haven't already, download and install the Vertcoin Qt wallet from https://github.com/vertcoin/vertcoin/releases.
Once your wallet is up and running, launch the OCM.  All you have to do to start your own node is click the 'Enable' 
button on the P2Pool section of the OCM, and it will automatically download, configure, and start a local P2Pool Node for you.
You can make your node public to allow other miners to join you!  Just foward the P2Pool mining port(usually 9171 for network 1 or 9181 for network 2) and the P2Pool P2P port(usually 9346 for network 1 or 9347 for network 2).
